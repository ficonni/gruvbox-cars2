# gruvbox-cars
A collection of car wallpapers adhering to the Gruvbox colorscheme. 

This would not be possible without the wonderfull work by Paulo Pacitti (https://github.com/paulopacitti/gruvbox-factory). He deserves all the credit, all I did was download 1k+ images and run the command lol.

The following racing series are featured in this collection :


World Endurance Championship


World Sportscar Championship


Formula 1


IndyCar


World Rally Championship


GT World Challenge


IMSA


NASCAR


Can / Am

and possibly more which I forgot lol.

Also, there are general sports cars / oldtimers / supercars present.

Recommend you use something like Variety and put these wallpapers on a rotating basis. Finally, there is both a tool and a set of wallpapers to take your        a e s t h e t i c        desktop to the next level. 

Happy ricing ! :)
